Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neuro-disorder in which a person has a lifelong effect
on interaction and communication with others. Autism can be diagnosed at any stage in one
life and is said to be a "behavioral disease" because in the first two years of life symptoms
usually appear. According to the ASD problem starts with childhood and continues to keep
going on into adolescence and adulthood. ASD is mainly caused by genetics or by
environmental factors; however, its conditions can be improved by detecting and treating it
at earlier stages. In the current times, clinical standardized tests are the only methods which
are being used, to diagnose ASD. This not only requires prolonged diagnostic time but also
faces a steep increase in medical costs. In this research, autism spectrum disorder prediction
has been investigated and compared using common parameters such as application type,
simulation method, comparison methodology, and input data. The key purpose of this study
is to give a centralized framework to use for researchers working on autism spectrum
disorder prediction. Propelled with the rise in use of machine learning techniques in the
research dimensions of medical diagnosis, in this paper there is an attempt to explore the
possibility to use Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural
Network and Convolutional Neural Network for predicting and analysis of ASD problems
in a child, adolescents, and adults.
